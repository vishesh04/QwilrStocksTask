To run the application locally -

1. Install Mongodb
2. Make sure Java is installed 
3. run `./grailsw r-a` from the root directory of this repository
4. Access the app at localhost:5000

Tech Stack - 

1. Mongodb as database
2. AngularJS frontend
3. Rest APIs written in Grails framework

Key decisions - 

Implemented 'Login with Google' for creating and logging in user. It had foloowing benefits - 

1. One less password to remember for user
2. Very user friendly. No verification of email id is required
3. Built in security. Application doesn’t store user’s password.
4. It cut down a lot of effort in creating login/signup UIs, email verification, forword password etc

Data API - 

To get the stocks data(company lookup and quotes), I chose markitondemand. This API is freely available with no rate limits. In my brief search, I found that yahoo doesn't have a official API, some reverse engineered versions are out there, but not reliable. Other reliable and official APIs were not freely available.
Since I didn't spent a lot of time for searching the API as this is a prototype app, I still kept the API calls layer well abstracted, so that replacing it with a new API becomes very easy.
